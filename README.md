# Algorithmic collusion in double-sided markets: A rideshare example

The paper related to this repo has been submitted to ITSC 2024 and is under review.
The PPO implementation used has been taken from https://github.com/seolhokim/Mujoco-Pytorch

# Dependencies
- pytorch
- pettingzoo
- wandb

_TODO: Update the requirements.txt_

# Instructions
Configuration parameters for the PPO algorithm can be found in the config.ini
OD matrix and the cost matrix can be directly changed in the run-custom.py
Executing run-custom.py will start the simulation and progress can be tracked in wandb.
